# Fullstack Application with Docker & PERN Stack

This is a fullstack web application I built while exploring Docker and the PERN stack (PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node.js). The purpose of this project was to experiment with Docker Compose and get hands-on experience with a modern tech stack while learning how to orchestrate different services effectively. 

While I ran into challenges along the way—especially with setting up Vite + React—this project helped me gain deeper insights into managing fullstack applications using Docker, working with PostgreSQL, and streamlining my development setup with modern tooling.

Feel free to explore the code as a coding sample if you're interested in seeing how I approached the implementation.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

### **Frontend**: React + Vite
- **React** is the framework used for building the user interface. It’s a popular choice for building fast, scalable applications due to its component-based architecture.
- **Vite** was used as the build tool to speed up the development process. It’s a next-gen tool that provides faster hot module reloading and builds compared to other bundlers, especially when working with React.

### **Backend**: TypeScript + Express
- The backend is built using **TypeScript** and **Express**, a minimalist web framework for Node.js. 
- **TypeScript** offers type safety and allows for better maintainability and readability, making it easier to scale as the application grows.
- **Express** provides the essential tools for handling routing, middleware, and HTTP requests efficiently.

### **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **PostgreSQL** is used for data storage in this project. It’s a powerful, open-source relational database that supports advanced data types and is well-suited for complex queries.
- I focused on learning how to interact with PostgreSQL directly and set up an optimized schema to store and retrieve data.

## 🛠️ Docker & Docker Compose

One of the main aspects of this project was **Docker**. All components (frontend, backend, and database) are containerized using Docker, which simplifies managing and deploying the application in different environments.

- **Docker**: Helps in packaging the application into containers, ensuring that it runs consistently across all environments.
- **Docker Compose**: Orchestrates the containers and manages services (frontend, backend, and PostgreSQL database) by defining them in a `docker-compose.yml` file. This allows for easy setup, teardown, and scaling of the application.

This centralized approach to managing Docker configurations makes it easier to maintain the system, ensuring all parts of the application can run together with minimal hassle.

## ⚙️ Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repo-name.git
   cd repo-name
   ```

2. Build and run the containers with Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

   This will:
   - Build the Docker images for the frontend, backend, and database.
   - Start the application, making it available at `http://localhost:3000` for the frontend and `http://localhost:5000` for the backend.

3. Make sure to configure any environment variables in the `.env` files if needed (e.g., for PostgreSQL).

- **docker-compose.yml**: Defines the services and how they should be run together using Docker Compose.
- **Dockerfile**: Contains the build instructions for both the backend and frontend containers.
- **.env**: Stores sensitive environment variables (e.g., database credentials).

## 🤖 Features & Challenges

- Dockerizing each component (frontend, backend, and database) to run seamlessly in isolated environments.
- Handling PostgreSQL data storage and querying.
- Setting up **TypeScript** in the backend for better maintainability and scalability.
- Overcoming challenges with Vite + React setup, ensuring the dev environment ran smoothly.

## 💡 Why This Project?

This project served as a hands-on experiment to solidify my understanding of Docker, the PERN stack. The learning process involved:
- Mastering Docker and Docker Compose for containerization and orchestration.
- Diving into PostgreSQL to understand its powerful features for relational data storage.
- Building a clean, modern fullstack application using React, Express, and TypeScript.
